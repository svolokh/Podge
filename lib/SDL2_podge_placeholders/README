This directory is where we provide stub implementations of SDL2 functions so we can compile Podge as a library without needing to link against the actual SDL2 libraries and all their other system dependencies.

The files are only updated here whenever we encounter linker errors when compiling with PODGE_LIBRARY (we are not aiming for a complete stub implementation of the SDL2 libraries).
